# For Coaches

## Code-Alongs

Code-alongs are the best thing you can do on a Sunday, if you come prepared.  Please take a minute to look through the code-alongs for each Sunday before coming to make sure you have an idea how you'll solve it on Sunday.  They are intentionally open-ended to give you a chance to adapt to the previous week's confusions and student questions. (you can find each one linked to in the week's lesson plan, or by filtering for the `code-along` & `incremental-development` tags in our GitHub Organization)

## Class Recordings

Recording your screen and your voice in class is enormously helpful to students over the week.  Feel free to use whatever softwares you're comfortable with, and to host the video however you like.  Just make sure to send a PR to `./class-recordings.md` for posterity :)
