# Week 2

## Prep Work

### Inspecting the DOM

* [Read through this site](https://hackyourfuture.be/inspecting-the-dom)
* [And practice studying some HTML/CSS here](https://janke-learning.org/dom-tutor)

### HTML & CSS

* [What is Responsive Design?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KGah8bW8GE)
* [ARIA landmark roles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4xHfi4t9S0&list=PLWjCJDeWfDdcEtSnqq_iGLKGA_H_3o3y7)

### Relative vs. Absolute Paths

Not super complicated, but a little tricky at first.   And this will come up _all the time_ forever.

## Assignments

This week you have 1 project, and 3 exercise sets.

### Project

This week's project is to study the __Responsive Template__ tutorial from Traversy Media.

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough!  You will be expected to turn in your code from his tutorial on a new repository, cleanly developed with one branch per step.  It's up to you to decide what counts as a step.  Take a look through [this example project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/built-with-branches) to get an idea of what an incrementally developed project looks like.  Be sure to also clone this repository and study it using GitKraken/VSC/Browser to explore what happens when you check out different branches.

Your repository will also need a  README containing a report on what you struggled with, what you learned, and what skills you now need to work.   You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your learning notes in the README.

There are two general paths you can take to get this finished repo, neither is better or worse.  And if you find another way go for it!
* __Two-Stepping__: First - follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.  Second - go through the tutorial another time, this time around focusing on using branches to create a finished repository.
* __One-Stepping__: Follow the tutorial once more slowly, carefully building your finished repository as you go.

But wait! Before you dive right in, take a minute to set up your homework on the module project board:

1. Start an empty repository called ```apptheme``` (Named _exactly_ this!)
1. Create an issue for this week's project in your class repo
    * ```YourName: week 2 - incremental development```
1. Move it to the "In Progres" column of this module's project board.
1. Open the [Responsive Template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlA7dputiNc) tutorial.
1. Begin studying!

### Exercises

There are 3 sets of exercises to start (and hopefully finish!).  One is on FreeCodeCamp, the other two are stand-alone repositories you will need to fork & clone.

* Sign in to FreeCodeCamp using your GitHub account:
  * Complete all 4 of FreeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design Principles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles/) challenges.
  * Turn on your public portfolio (if you haven't yet) so we can give feedback on your code
* Fork and Clone [HTML-CSS-Practice-Problems](https://github.com/DevMountain/HTML-CSS-Practice-Problems) (if you haven't already):
  * Complete the exercises in `./level-2`
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* Fork and Clone [css-exercises](https://github.com/dangodev/css-exercises)
  * Complete `exercise-3`, `exercise-4` and `exercise-5`
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
