  <p>Learning to break a whole application into user stories takes experience.</p>
  <p>This is easier to learn by practicing with existing applications instead of ones you dream up.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The first step to mastering user stories is to practice asking and answering these questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>What are the different components on the user interface?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What interaction does each component enable a user to have with your website?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>How do these stories depend on each other?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What is a logical order for building these stories?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Let&#39;s see these questions in action with a simple website:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://tomato-timer.com/" target="_blank">tomato timer!</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are some possible answers to these questions based on the Tomato Timer</p>
  <p>(but not the only answers! there are many ways to split a project):</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>1. What are the different components on the user
    interface?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a red button that says &quot;stop&quot;</li>
    <li>There is a white button that says &quot;reset&quot;</li>
    <li>There are some numbers</li>
    <li>There is a green button that says &quot;start&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. What interaction does each component enable a user to have with your website?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A user can stop the count-down without resetting the time</li>
    <li>A user can stop the count-down and set it back to 25:00</li>
    <li>A user can see how much time is left</li>
    <li>A user can start (or restart!) the count-down</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. How do these stories depend on each other?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can&#39;t stop a count-down unless it is started</li>
    <li>It is not practical to be able to reset the count-down every time you want to stop it</li>
    <li>You can see how much time is left without being able to start the timer (even if this isn&#39;t very useful :)
    </li>
    <li>There is no point to have a count-down until there is a time to see</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4. What is a logical order for building these stories?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A user can see how much time is left</li>
    <li>A user can start (or restart!) the count-down</li>
    <li>A user can stop the count-down without resetting the time</li>
    <li>A user can stop the count-down and set it back to 25:00</li>
  </ol>
